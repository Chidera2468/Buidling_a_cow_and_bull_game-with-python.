Architecture:
The game can be divided into several components:

User Interface: This component handles user input and displays game information.

Game Logic: It manages the core game rules, generates the secret number, and checks the user's guesses.

Random Number Generation: You'll need to generate a random 4-digit number for the user to guess.

Data Storage (Optional): You can store high scores or other game data in files or a database.



Technologies:

Python: Python is the primary programming language for implementing the game logic.

User Interface Libraries:

Tkinter: For creating a simple graphical user interface.
Console Input/Output: For a text-based interface.
Random Number Generation:

The built-in random module in Python can be used to generate a random 4-digit number.
Data Storage (Optional):

File I/O: You can use Python's file handling capabilities to read and write data to text files.
SQLite: If you want a more structured approach, you can use the SQLite library for a simple database to store high scores.
